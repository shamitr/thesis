Results indicate that different machine learning models inherently show different levels of biases. For an experiment on this theory, have a look at: https://github.com/maxkrawietz/Thesis. \\In this repository, I explore different machine learning models when they are confronted with an imbalance between protected group categories and evaluate their outcomes with respect to fairness. I hypothesized that an increase in imbalance will deteriorate classification fairness and that some models will be inherently more successful in mitigating dataset biases than others.
