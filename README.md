Results indicate that different machine learning models inherently show different levels of biases. For an experiment on this theory, have a look at: https://github.com/maxkrawietz/Thesis. <br /> This repository explores different machine learning models when they are confronted with an unequal representation of demographics (for example females vs. males) and evaluates their outcomes with respect to fairness. I expected that an increase in imbalance will deteriorate classification fairness and that some models will be inherently more successful in mitigating dataset biases than others.
